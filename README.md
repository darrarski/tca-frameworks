# The Composable Architecture XCFrameworks

Experimental script for building binary XCFrameworks of [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) and its dependencies.

## üìñ Documentation

- It's an experiment, not ready to be used in a production environment.
- Run `build.sh` and go make yourself a coffee.
- Tested with Swift 5.10 from Xcode 15.4 RC1.
- [Spicio](https://github.com/giginet/Scipio) is used for generating XCFrameworks into `Frameworks` directory.
- Generated XCFrameworks supports iOS, iOS Simulator, and macOS architecture.
- Swift Macros binaries are copied into `Macros` directory. These can be linked to a project using "Other Swift Flags" `-load-plugin-executable`.
- Script does not cache any build artifacts on its own.
- It takes ~17 minutes to fetch, build, and generate everything on a MacBook Pro with M1 Max processor.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Examples

- [swift-package-example](Examples/swift-package-example) - integrating into SPM library.
